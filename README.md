# cfndsl-primer

## Introduction
This repo serves as an elevator pitch for using the cfndsl (link) library, mainly:
1. Explain cfndsl from a perspective of someone who knows CloudFormation already
2. Show limitations of CloudFormation and how cfndsl can overcome these
3. Show features of cfndsl to show how powerful of a tool it is
4. Demonstrate through use of examples that you can use cfndsl for any solution, simple or complex, that you were going to do using regular CloudFormation.

Because of the power of cfndsl, its primary users know how to create solutions to complex CloudFormation requirements - especially in relation a pipeline with many variables and conditions. This is intimidating for those who are not familiar to how cfndsl works so we wish to build up confidence that you can do (bold) exactly what you would normally do in CloudFormation but to your suprise in a much more simple way

## Prior Knowledge
* You should have an understanding of AWS CloudFormation and how to create a CloudFormation template, as CFNDSL is a wrapper for CloudFormation templates
* It is recommended to have a basic understanding of programming languages and its concepts. You do not need to know Ruby, but you will be able to do more if you pick up more understanding of Ruby and the way it works - it is most helpful to know how to translate lists, objects and values defined in yaml/json to Ruby as well

## Requirements
* Have ruby installed on your computer

## Setup
Run the command on your computer
```
bundle install
```
To install the rubygems that are dependent on this project.
